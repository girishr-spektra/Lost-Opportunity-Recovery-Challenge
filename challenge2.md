# Challenge 2 - Ship the Sales Product

## Overview

Take the grounded Microsoft Foundry agent you built in Challenge 1 and give it a face that sales reps can actually use. You will create a Copilot Studio agent with conversation topics for loss analysis, strategy recommendations, and re-engagement email drafting. You will also automate the CRM so that every deal marked as lost in Dynamics 365 automatically triggers AI analysis and creates a follow-up task - no manual steps from the rep.

The challenge is complete when the copilot is live, the CRM automation flow has run successfully, and a rep can get grounded recovery guidance through a single conversation.

---

## Prerequisites

- Challenge 1 complete - your AI Search index is populated and the Microsoft Foundry agent is tested.
- Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio (included with your M365 license).
- Power Automate Premium (included in your environment).
- Dynamics 365 Sales access (pre-provisioned).

---

## Objectives

### 1. Sales Intelligence Copilot

Create the conversational interface that gives sales reps access to the Foundry agent's capabilities.

- In Microsoft Copilot Studio, verify that the **ODL environment** is selected from the environment picker before creating the agent.
- Create a new agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio with the following name:
  ```
  Sales Recovery Copilot
  ```
- Connect Azure AI Search as a knowledge source, pointing to your `lost-opportunities` index from Challenge 1.
- Configure the agent's instructions to enforce grounded, cited responses - every answer must reference specific indexed deal records, not generic sales advice.

---

### 2. Conversation Topics

Design topics that route different types of rep queries to the right behavior.

- Create three topics covering the following scenarios:
  - **Lost Deal Analysis** - the rep provides an opportunity or account name; the agent returns the primary and contributing loss reasons detected from indexed deal content, and references comparable deals with the same loss profile.
  - **Revised Strategy** - the rep describes the loss context; the agent returns a specific, actionable revised strategy grounded in historical patterns from the index - not generic advice.
  - **Re-engagement Email** - the rep requests a draft email for a specific lost deal; the agent produces a personalized email referencing the decision-maker's documented concerns, the revised approach, and a clear call to action.
- Configure a fallback topic that surfaces a clear "not found" message rather than fabricating an answer for out-of-scope questions.
- Test each topic in the Copilot Studio canvas before publishing. Every response for an in-scope query should include a citation to the source deal record.

### 3. CRM Automation with Power Automate

Build the automation that ensures no lost deal goes unanalyzed. When a rep marks an opportunity as lost in Dynamics 365, the flow automatically runs AI analysis and creates a follow-up task.

- In Power Automate, create a new **Automated cloud flow** with the following name:
  ```
  Lost Opportunity Flow
  ```
- Set the trigger to **Microsoft Dataverse - When a row is added, modified or deleted**:
  - **Change type:** Modified
  - **Table name:** Opportunities
  - **Scope:** Organization

  > **Note:** The Opportunities table can take a few seconds to appear in the dropdown. If it does not show, wait briefly and refresh - avoid using a custom value as that may break the binding.

- Add a filter so the flow only runs when **Status Reason** equals **Lost**:
  - In the trigger's **Advanced parameters**, set **Filter rows** to:
    ```
    statuscode eq 5
    ```

- Add a **Microsoft Dataverse - Get a row by ID** action to retrieve the full opportunity record:
  - **Table name:** Opportunities
  - **Row ID:** the unique opportunity identifier from the trigger output.

- Add an action to run AI analysis on the retrieved deal content. Use either of the following, depending on what your environment supports:
  - **Option A - Foundry agent (recommended for this lab):** Use an **HTTP** action to POST to your Microsoft Foundry chat completions endpoint. Pass the opportunity **Topic** and **Description** in the request body and instruct the model to identify the primary loss reason and recommend one specific re-engagement action.
  - **Option B - AI Builder:** Use **AI Builder - Create text with GPT** with the same instructions.

  > **Note:** If AI Builder returns `EntitlementNotAvailable / NoCapacity`, your sandbox has no AI Builder credits - switch to the HTTP option (Option A) and call the Foundry endpoint directly.

- Add a **Parse JSON** action on the AI response so you can reference the generated text downstream. For a Foundry chat completion response, the analysis text is at:
  ```
  choices[0].message.content
  ```

- Add a **Microsoft Dataverse - Add a new row** action to create a **Task** record:
  - **Table name:** Tasks
  - **Subject:** `Lost Opportunity Analysis - @{Name}` (where `Name` comes from the Get a row by ID step)
  - **Description:** the AI-generated text parsed in the previous step
  - **Due Date:** `addDays(utcNow(), 5)`

  > **Note:** Do not populate any **Regarding (Opportunities)** lookup field with the raw opportunity GUID - this causes an `ODataUnrecognizedPathException` because Dataverse expects a full OData binding (`/opportunities(<id>)`), not a bare ID. Leave the Regarding field blank for this lab.

- Add a **Condition** after the AI step to check whether the generated text is empty. If empty, use **Send an email (V2)** to notify the assigned rep to run manual analysis instead of creating an empty task.

- Save and test the flow by opening one of your imported opportunities in Dynamics 365 and changing its **Status Reason** to **Lost**. Confirm a Task is created with the AI-generated analysis in the Description field.

### 4. Publish and Validate

Publish the copilot and confirm the full system works end-to-end.

- Publish the copilot to a **web channel** or **Microsoft Teams channel**.
- Open the published channel and confirm the copilot loads and responds.
- Run the following three validation scenarios through the live channel:
  - **Scenario A - Competitor Loss Analysis:** Provide an opportunity lost to a named competitor. Confirm the response identifies the competitor, references comparable deals, and describes the loss pattern.
  - **Scenario B - Pricing Strategy:** Select a deal lost due to pricing objection. Ask for a revised strategy. Confirm the response is specific to that deal's context - not generic cost-cutting advice.
  - **Scenario C - Re-engagement Email:** Select a high-value lost deal. Request a re-engagement email. Confirm the email addresses the decision-maker by name or role, references specific concerns from the deal record, and includes a clear call to action.
- All three responses must be grounded in indexed deal data with deal-level citations. Generic responses are not acceptable.

<validation step="6c0275b6-7954-4507-9d04-32e9ebd9ce83" />
 
> **Congratulations** on completing the Challenge! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
