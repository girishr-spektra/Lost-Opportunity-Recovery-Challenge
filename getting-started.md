## Download the Opportunity Dataset

A dataset of 20 closed-lost opportunity records has been prepared for this lab. You will upload this file to Azure Blob Storage in Challenge 1 - download it now so it is ready.

1. Download the dataset file:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Lost-Opportunity-Recovery-Challenge/main/data/opportunities.csv
   ```

   Save the file to your Desktop or Downloads folder. This CSV contains 20 lost deals across five loss-reason categories (Pricing, Competitor, Product Fit, Long Approval Cycle, Delayed Response) and is the data source you will index in Challenge 1.
