## Explore Your Dynamics 365 Environment

Your sandbox includes a pre-configured Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise environment. You will import the opportunity dataset in the next section.

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the Dynamics 365 home portal:

   ```
   https://home.dynamics.com
   ```

   Sign in with the provided credentials. The portal displays all Dynamics 365 apps available in your environment.

1. Locate **Sales Hub** in the app list and click it to open Dynamics 365 Sales.

   > **Note:** If Sales Hub is not listed, select **All Apps** or search for "Sales Hub" using the search bar at the top of the page. If it still does not appear, navigate to `https://make.powerapps.com`, select the environment from the top-right selector, go to **Apps**, and look for **Sales Hub** there.

1. Navigate to **Sales** > **Opportunities** and confirm the app loads correctly. The opportunities list will be empty at this point - you will import the dataset in the next section.

   > **Note:** If you cannot access the Opportunities view, confirm you are in the correct Dynamics 365 environment. Navigate to **Settings > Advanced Settings > Security > Users** and verify your user account has the **System Administrator** role assigned.

## Import the Opportunity Dataset

Your environment does not have pre-seeded sales data. Import the provided dataset to populate Dynamics 365 with 20 closed-lost opportunity records across five loss reason categories before starting Challenge 1.

1. Download the dataset file from the lab repository:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Lost-Opportunity-Recovery-Challenge/main/data/opportunities.csv
   ```

   Save the file to your Desktop or Downloads folder.

1. In Dynamics 365 Sales, select the **Settings** gear icon (top right) and navigate to **Advanced Settings**.

1. In the Business Management area, select **Data Management**, then select **Imports**.

1. Select **Import Data** and upload the `opportunities.csv` file you downloaded.

1. On the **Upload Data File** page, confirm the file type is detected as CSV and select **Next**.

1. On the **Select Data Map** page, select **Default (Automatic Mapping)** and select **Next**.

1. On the **Map Record Types** page, map the file to the **Opportunity** record type and select **Next**.

1. On the **Map Fields** page, confirm the following column mappings:

   | CSV Column | Dynamics 365 Field |
   |---|---|
   | Topic | Topic |
   | Account Name | Potential Customer |
   | Estimated Revenue | Est. Revenue |
   | Actual Close Date | Actual Close Date |
   | Description | Description |

   Map any remaining columns as best fit and select **Next**.

1. On the **Review Settings and Import Data** page, select **Submit** to start the import. The import runs in the background and typically completes within 2-3 minutes.

1. Navigate to **Opportunities** and confirm 20 records are present. Filter by **Status Reason = Lost** to verify the closed-lost records are visible.

   > **Note:** If the import fails or record count is less than 20, re-download the CSV and retry. Ensure the file was not modified before upload. Contact CloudLabs support if the issue persists.
